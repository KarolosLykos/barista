Package timing provides a testable interface for timing and scheduling.

This makes it simple to update a module at a fixed interval or
at a fixed point in time.

Typically, modules will make a scheduler:
    mod.sch = timing.NewScheduler()
and use the scheduling calls to control the update timing:
    mod.sch.Every(time.Second)

The Stream() goroutine will then loop over the ticker, and update
the module with fresh information:
    for range mod.sch.Tick() {
	  // update code.
    }

This will automatically suspend processing when the bar is hidden.

Modules should also use timing.Now() instead of time.Now() to control time
during tests.

package timing // import "barista.run/timing"

import "time"

// Now returns the current time.
var Now = time.Now

// Scheduler represents a trigger that can be repeating or one-off, and
// is intrinsically tied to the running bar. This means that if the trigger
// condition occurs while the bar is paused, it will not fire until the bar
// is next resumed, making it ideal for scheduling work that should only be
// performed while the bar is active.
type Scheduler interface {
	// Tick returns a channel that receives an empty value
	// when the scheduler is triggered.
	Tick() <-chan struct{}

	// At sets the scheduler to trigger a specific time.
	// This will replace any pending triggers.
	At(time.Time) Scheduler

	// After sets the scheduler to trigger after a delay.
	// This will replace any pending triggers.
	After(time.Duration) Scheduler

	// Every sets the scheduler to trigger at an interval.
	// This will replace any pending triggers.
	Every(time.Duration) Scheduler

	// Stop cancels all further triggers for the scheduler.
	Stop()
}
