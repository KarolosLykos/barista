Package timing provides a testable interface for timing and scheduling.

This makes it simple to update a module at a fixed interval or
at a fixed point in time.

Typically, modules will make a scheduler:
    mod.sch = timing.NewScheduler()
and use the scheduling calls to control the update timing:
    mod.sch.Every(time.Second)

The Stream() goroutine will then loop over the ticker, and update
the module with fresh information:
    for range mod.sch.C {
	  // update code.
    }

This will automatically suspend processing when the bar is hidden.

Modules should also use timing.Now() instead of time.Now() to control time
during tests.

package timing // import "barista.run/timing"

import "time"

// Now returns the current time.
var Now = time.Now
